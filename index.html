<h1>Authority, a customizable arena FPS</h1>
<h3>By: Xander Productions</h3>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Authority, is an arena shooter that I have been working on for a few days. <br> I have been designing and polishing this concept for a year. <br> The goal is to have a working prototype by 4/27/22
</p>

<div> </div>

<h2>Classes</h2>

<p>Authority will have 4 main classes. The Assault, Recon, Tank, and Support. <br> The Assault class will be the average rifleman class that has the most average stats.<br> The Recon uses sniper rifles and has a lower health and has a smaller size.<br> The Tank uses shotguns but is much taller and is slower with more health.<br> The Support uses pistols and is the smallest class in the game with no armor and the fastest speed.</p>

<h2>Movement</h2>

<p>The movement in Authority will be complex. The goal is to have fast moving fights in the air and on the ground.<br> The planned movement mechanics include, Sprinting, Sliding, Crouching, and Wall-Running.<br> I want the game to be fast and exciting while also being challenging.</p>

<div> </div>

<h2>Weapons</h2>

<p>The weapons in Authority will be simple to use but hard to master.<br> Each weapon will have a different feel using visual tweaks.<br> All weapons will have recoil and camera shake to give a punchy feel.<br> Making the weapons feel good to use is my primary objective. </p>

<div> </div>

<h2>Abilities</h2>

<p>Each class in Authority has multiple abilties they can choose from, while only one will be used.<br> Abilities give the player a better chance to win a fight but also allow you to lose a fight.<br> Each player will be able to choose an ultimate abilities. Ultimates have a charge that is gained through a match by doing damage.<br> Ultimate abilities are very strong and can easily help your team win the fight. </p>

<div> </div>

<h2>Game Mode</h2>

<p>The main game mode in Authority is called Multi-Capture.<br>Multi-Capture works like capture point in every other game but has one small twist.<br>Multi-Capture has one main capture point and a secondary capture point.<br> The main capture point scores 2 points per capture tick. While the secondary only scores 1 point.<br> There are two different secondary point locations on the map. One of the point will unlock and lock every few minutes. </p>
